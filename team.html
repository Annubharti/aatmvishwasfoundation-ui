                            in Araria since 2010. My journey in the social sector began in 2010 when I joined Jan Jagran
                            Shakti Sangathan, marking the commencement of a transformative path. Over the course of
                            nearly a decade, I dedicated myself to organizing communities and advocating for their
                            rights and empowerment through my work at Jan Jagran Shakti Sangathan.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>In July 2021, I
                            transitioned to Project Potential organization, where I contributed for 18 months. Drawing
                            inspiration from my experiences, I co-founded the Aatmvishwas Foundation in July 2022,
                            located in Amgachhi Panchayat of Sikti block, Araria district. Our initiative, the
                            Aatmvishwas Center, focuses on providing free education and fostering youth development
                            in Amgachhi. </p><br>
                        <p> Concurrently, I pursued my studies and recently completed my graduation. My
                            educational journey continues, as I aspire to pursue a Master of Social Work, which I plan
                            to commence soon. Through the Aatmvishwas Foundation, I aim to continue my efforts in
                            driving positive change within society. </p>

                        <p class="desic content">
                            I joined Jan Jagran Shakti Sangathan (JJSS) in 2013 and have since been
                            deeply involved in various social initiatives. During a fellowship in 2015, I interned at
                            JJSS, teaching children and organizing sports activities in villages. In 2016, I
                            participated in the Narmada Bachao Andolan in Madhya Pradesh, gaining insights into
                            grassroots struggles.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>

                            I also worked with Project Potential, using drama for community engagement, and with Charm
                            organization, empowering women through internet literacy.

                            In 2018, I participated in a foundational workshop at Himachal Pradesh Sambhavna Kendra,
                            organized by JJSS. I later moved to Saharsa, continuing my work with JJSS, teaching children
                            through sports and advocating for people's rights.

                        <br>
                        <p>

                            After gaining experiences from different organizations I co-founded
                            the Aatmvishwas Foundation Center in my home-town
                            focusing on basic education and youth development.

                            I am also pursuing the Jeevt Fellowship project with Project Potential in the School of
                            Programming, aiming to make a positive impact on society through education and empowerment
                            initiatives. </p>

                    <h2>About Us</h2>
                    <p>A group of education and social enthusiasts initiated a learning center in Amagachi village,
                        Bihar, addressing the region's educational and developmental gaps. Led by Vijay Paswan, the
                        center, established in October 2022 with limited resources, currently supports 50-60 kids
                        without formal school access. The team comprises volunteers juggling full-time jobs to sustain
                        both their families and this meaningful initiative.</p>
